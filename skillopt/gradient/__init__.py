"""SkillOpt Gradient -- trajectory analysis and patch generation.

Analogous to gradient computation in neural network training: analyzes
minibatch rollout trajectories to produce skill-edit patches (the "gradient"
that drives skill updates).

Modules
-------
- reflect: minibatch trajectory analysis (gradient computation)
- aggregate: hierarchical patch merging (gradient aggregation)
