"""ReflACT: Reflective Agent Tuning.

A general-purpose framework for iteratively optimizing LLM agent skills
through structured reflection and self-improvement.

Pipeline stages:
  1. Rollout   — execute episodes with current skill
  2. Reflect   — analyze trajectories, generate patches
  3. Aggregate — hierarchical merge of patches
  4. Select    — rank and select top edits
  5. Update    — apply edits to skill document
  6. Evaluate  — validate candidate skill, accept/reject
