"""SkillOpt-Sleep — multi-rollout + contrastive reflection ("脑补推演" core).

The user's insight: let the agent re-run the SAME task many times, then look at
which rollouts went well vs badly and distill a rule from the *contrast*. This
is a much stronger learning signal than a single failure, and it is the essence
of the offline "dream/imagination" process — train-time rollouts are synthetic,
so doing many is fine.

Pieces:
  * multi_rollout   — run one task K times under (skill, memory), return scored attempts
  * contrastive_reflect — given good vs bad attempts of the same tasks, ask the
    optimizer what distinguishes them and propose a general rule

Driven through the Backend abstraction (mock/claude/codex), import-light.
