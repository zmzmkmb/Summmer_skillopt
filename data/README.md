# Data Manifests

This directory releases lightweight split manifests for the SkillOpt paper
splits. These manifests are not full runnable benchmark payloads. To evaluate a
benchmark, first materialize the full examples from the raw data source when
needed, then point `--split_dir` at the split directory listed below.

In this README, "coverage" describes which part of the upstream benchmark the
manifest references. It does not mean the released manifest directory contains
the full runnable examples.

## Layout

Every released manifest directory uses the same file layout:

```text
data/<benchmark>_<manifest_type>/
|-- split_manifest.json
|-- train/items.json
|-- val/items.json
`-- test/items.json
```

`split_manifest.json` records source metadata, split counts, and item fields.
Each `items.json` contains only stable IDs or source-path hints.

## Released Splits

| Manifest directory | Benchmark | Counts | Coverage | Raw data source | `split_dir` |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `searchqa_id_split/` | SearchQA | 400 / 200 / 1400 | Official HF dataset IDs | [lucadiliello/searchqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lucadiliello/searchqa) | `data/searchqa_split` |
| `livemathematicianbench_id_split/` | LiveMathematicianBench | 35 / 18 / 124 | Four official monthly files | [LiveMathematicianBench/LiveMathematicianBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiveMathematicianBench/LiveMathematicianBench) | `data/livemathematicianbench_split` |
| `docvqa_id_split/` | DocVQA | 107 / 53 / 374 | 10% subset of validation | [lmms-lab/DocVQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/DocVQA) | `data/docvqa/splits` |
| `officeqa_id_split/` | OfficeQA | 50 / 24 / 172 | OfficeQA Full | [databricks/officeqa](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/officeqa) | `data/officeqa_split` |
| `spreadsheetbench_id_split/` | SpreadsheetBench | 80 / 40 / 280 | SpreadsheetBench Verified 400 | [KAKA22/SpreadsheetBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KAKA22/SpreadsheetBench) | `data/spreadsheetbench_split` |
| `alfworld_path_split/` | ALFWorld | 39 / 18 / 134 | ALFWorld `json_2.1.1` paths | [alfworld/alfworld](https://github.com/alfworld/alfworld) | `data/alfworld_path_split` |

Counts are ordered as train / val / test.

## Direct Use

Only `alfworld_path_split/` can be used directly as `--split_dir` from this
release, because the ALFWorld loader reads `gamefile` and `task_type` from the
split items.

This does not mean the ALFWorld raw data is included. You still need to
download ALFWorld separately with `alfworld-download` and set `$ALFWORLD_DATA`
to the data root containing `json_2.1.1`.

The other manifest directories are lookup manifests. They intentionally omit
full example fields such as questions, answers, contexts, images, or task
instructions. Materialize those benchmarks into the `split_dir` paths listed
above before running SkillOpt.

## Lookup Keys

The manifests are sufficient to locate the corresponding raw examples after
the raw data has been downloaded or otherwise made available:

| Benchmark | Manifest lookup key |
|---|---|
| SearchQA | Match `items.json[].id` to the `key` field in `lucadiliello/searchqa`. |
| LiveMathematicianBench | Open `source_file`, then match `no`; the manifest `id` is `<month>:<no>`. |
| DocVQA | Match `questionId` within the official DocVQA `validation` split; `image_path` records the expected local image path. |
| OfficeQA | Match `uid` in `officeqa_full.csv`; `source_files` and `source_docs` identify the supporting document. |
| SpreadsheetBench | Match `id`; `spreadsheet_path` identifies the referenced spreadsheet directory. |
| ALFWorld | Resolve `gamefile` relative to `$ALFWORLD_DATA`. |

## Benchmark Notes

### SearchQA

`searchqa_id_split/` is an ID-only manifest. Each released `id` exactly matches
the `key` field in `lucadiliello/searchqa`.

Materialized examples must include the fields consumed by the SearchQA
environment, including:

```text
question
context
answers
```

### LiveMathematicianBench

`livemathematicianbench_id_split/` was generated from these raw files:

```text
data/202511/qa_202511_final.json
data/202512/qa_202512_final.json
data/202601/qa_202601_final.json
data/202602/qa_202602_final.json
```

The manifest stores IDs in the loader format:

```text
<month>:<no>
```

Materialized examples must include:

```text
question
choices
correct_choice
theorem_type
theorem
sketch
paper_link
```

### DocVQA

`docvqa_id_split/` records `docvqa_validation_10pct`: a 10% subset sampled from
the official DocVQA `validation` split.

```text
source_split: validation
docvqa_validation_10pct: train=107, val=53, test=374
```

Each manifest item contains question/document IDs plus image location metadata.
Materialized examples must provide `question`, `answer` or `ground_truth`, and
an `image_path` that resolves locally.

### OfficeQA

`officeqa_id_split/` records the split over OfficeQA Full
(`officeqa_full.csv`). The official OfficeQA CSVs are gated on Hugging Face, so
materialization requires authorized access.

Each manifest item contains `uid`, `category`, `source_files`, and
`source_docs` hints. Materialized examples must include `question` and
`ground_truth` or `answer`.

### SpreadsheetBench

`spreadsheetbench_id_split/` records the split over SpreadsheetBench Verified
400, from `spreadsheetbench_verified_400.tar.gz`.

Each manifest item contains task identity metadata such as `id`,
`spreadsheet_path`, and `instruction_type`. Materialization must also place the
referenced spreadsheet directories at:

```text
data/spreadsheetbench_verified_400
```

### ALFWorld

`alfworld_path_split/` records `gamefile` paths relative to `$ALFWORLD_DATA`.
The source payload is `json_2.1.1`, which must be downloaded separately with
`alfworld-download`.

This manifest can be used directly as `--split_dir` after `$ALFWORLD_DATA`
points to the local ALFWorld data root containing `json_2.1.1`.
