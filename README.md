# SkillOpt: Executive Strategy for Self-Evolving Agent Skills

*Train agent skills like you train neural networks — with epochs, (mini-)batchsize, learning rates, and validation gates — but without touching model weights.*

## News 🔥🔥🔥
- **[2026-06-14]** 😴 **SkillOpt-Sleep (preview).** A nightly *sleep cycle* for local coding agents (Claude Code / Codex / Copilot): review past sessions offline, replay recurring tasks, and consolidate validated skills behind a held-out gate. This is an early **preview** — open-source and decoupled from the paper code — that we'll keep iterating on. See [`plugins/`](plugins/) and the [section below](#-skillopt-sleep--the-deployment-time-companion).
- **[2026-06-03]** 🎉 **[gbrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain), [gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/2026-06-03-skillopt.md), and [darwin-skill](https://github.com/alchaincyf/darwin-skill) have all integrated SkillOpt.**
- **[2026-06-02]** 🎉 **SkillOpt [v0.1.0](https://github.com/microsoft/SkillOpt/releases/tag/v0.1.0) is now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/skillopt/)!** Install with `pip install skillopt`. This initial release includes the full training loop (rollout → reflect → aggregate → select → update → evaluate), multi-backend support (OpenAI / Azure / Claude / Qwen / MiniMax), six built-in benchmarks, and WebUI dashboard.

## Overview

Modern agent skills are usually hand-crafted, generated one-shot by a strong
LLM, or evolved through loosely controlled self-revision — none of which
behaves like a deep-learning optimizer for the skill itself, and none of
which reliably improves over its starting point under feedback.

**SkillOpt treats the skill document as the trainable state of a frozen
agent**, and trains it with the discipline that makes weight-space
optimization reproducible. A separate optimizer model turns scored rollouts
into bounded add / delete / replace edits on a single skill document; a
candidate edit is accepted only when it strictly improves a held-out
validation score. A textual learning-rate budget, a rejected-edit buffer,
and an epoch-wise slow / meta update make skill training stable while
adding **zero inference-time model calls** at deployment.

The deployed artifact is a compact `best_skill.md` (typically 300–2,000
tokens) that runs against the unchanged target model. Across **six
benchmarks, seven target models, and three execution harnesses** (direct
chat, Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI), SkillOpt is best or tied-best on **all
52 evaluated (model, benchmark, harness) cells** and on GPT-5.5 lifts the
average no-skill accuracy by **+23.5 points in direct chat, +24.8 inside
the Codex agentic loop, and +19.1 inside Claude Code**. Optimized skill
artifacts transfer across model scales, between Codex and Claude Code
harnesses, and to nearby benchmarks without further optimization.

For the full method, ablations, and per-cell results see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.23904); for a visual walkthrough of the loop see the [project page](https://microsoft.github.io/SkillOpt/); for deeper API / backend / benchmark docs see [`docs/`](docs/).

## 😴 SkillOpt-Sleep — the deployment-time companion

> **Preview.** SkillOpt-Sleep is an early preview that we are actively iterating
> on; interfaces and defaults may change. Feedback and issues are welcome.

SkillOpt (above) trains a skill offline on a benchmark. **SkillOpt-Sleep**
applies the same discipline to *your own daily usage*: it gives a local coding
agent a nightly **sleep cycle** that reviews your past sessions, replays your
recurring tasks on your own API budget, and consolidates what it learns into
**validated** long-term memory and skills — behind a held-out gate, staged for
your review. The agent gets better the more you use it, with no weight training.

It synthesizes **SkillOpt** (validation-gated bounded text edits), **Claude
Dreams** (offline consolidation; review-then-adopt), and the **agent sleep**
idea (short-term experience → long-term competence). One "night":

```
harvest Claude Code / Codex Desktop transcripts → mine recurring tasks → replay offline
   → consolidate (reflect → bounded edit → GATE on real held-out tasks)
   → stage proposal → (you) adopt
```

**Plugins for three agents** (one engine, three thin shells — see [`plugins/`](plugins/)):

| Platform | Folder | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | [`plugins/claude-code`](plugins/claude-code) | `/plugin marketplace add ./plugins/claude-code` → `/skillopt-sleep` |
| **Codex** | [`plugins/codex`](plugins/codex) | `bash plugins/codex/install.sh` → `skillopt-sleep` skill |
| **Copilot** | [`plugins/copilot`](plugins/copilot) | register `plugins/copilot/mcp_server.py` as an MCP server |

**Validated on real models.** On the public
[gbrain-evals](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain-evals) `skillopt-v1` benchmark,
deficient skills go **0.00 → 1.00** on held-out sets with **both Claude and
Codex** (all 4 seeds, including a real tool-use loop), cross-model transfer is
positive, and the gate blocks regressions
([full results](docs/sleep/FINAL_REPORT.md)).

> **Open-source tool, decoupled from the research.** The engine lives in the
> top-level [`skillopt_sleep/`](skillopt_sleep) package with **zero dependency**
> on the paper's `skillopt/` experiment code (the validation gate is vendored).
> Controls — optional gate, multi-rollout contrastive reflection, token/time
> budget, multi-objective reward, user preferences, optimizer/target split — are
> documented in [`docs/sleep/CONTROLLABLE_DREAMING.md`](docs/sleep/CONTROLLABLE_DREAMING.md).

Deterministic proof (no API key): `python -m skillopt_sleep.experiments.run_experiment --persona researcher --assert-improves`.

For local sleep cycles, transcript source and replay backend are separate knobs:
use `--source claude` for Claude Code transcripts, `--source codex` for Codex
Desktop archived sessions under `~/.codex/archived_sessions`, and
`--backend codex` only when you want the replay/optimizer to spend Codex budget.

## Extensibility & WebUI

### Adding a new backend

A backend = a chat / exec target (e.g. `openai_chat`, `claude_chat`,
`qwen_chat`, `minimax_chat`, `codex_exec`, `claude_code_exec`). See
[`docs/guide/new-backend.md`](docs/guide/new-backend.md) for the full
contract; in short you add a `skillopt/model/<name>_backend.py` module,
register it in `skillopt/model/common.py` + `backend_config.py`, and wire
it through the router in `skillopt/model/__init__.py`. `qwen_backend.py`
and `minimax_backend.py` are good templates.

### Adding a new benchmark

A benchmark = a `skillopt/envs/<name>/` package with a `dataloader.py`, a
`rollout.py`, and an `initial.md` seed skill. See
[`docs/guide/new-benchmark.md`](docs/guide/new-benchmark.md) for the full
contract; the simplest reference is `skillopt/envs/searchqa/`.

### WebUI

Launch the monitoring dashboard (optional):

```bash
pip install -e ".[webui]"
python -m skillopt_webui.app
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--port` | 7860 | Server port |
| `--host` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `--share` | off | Create a public Gradio share link |
